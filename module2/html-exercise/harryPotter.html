    <h3>The world is divided between Harry Potter fans and those who consider bespectacled boy wizards a proper load of
      Hogwarts.</h3>
    <p> This year marks the 20th anniversary of the first novel in JK Rowling’s 400-million selling series, and the
      fanfare has been predictably deafening. Yet among Potter agnostics the saga’s hallowed status is a source of
      ongoing bafflement.</p>

    <h2> His friends </h2>
    <p> The Trio, sometimes known as the Golden Trio, was the popular name given to the gang of three best friends and
      former Gryffindor students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, being Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and
      Hermione Granger. The trio was allied with the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and Albus Dumbledore, and
      in their adult lives and careers, the British Ministry of Magic.</p>

    <h2> Is Harry Potter a true story? </h2>
    <p> While no, there is no actual Harry Potter, he was based on a real person! JK Rowling drew her inspiration for
      The Boy Who Lived from her neighbor Ian Potter who lived just four doors down from Rowling when she was a child.
